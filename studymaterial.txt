we can create react element using React.createElement() method and using JSX, using JSX is esy way to create element. 

jSX- javascript syntax extension

functional component (no need to import special type of package for functional component)

Class based component (need to import Component Package for Class component and use "this" property as well)

(third party package which need to install)- typechecking with propTypes-  propType & isRequired & default


State- state is similar to prop, we can create state only in class component.

we can not change props directly because props is readonly property, we can change props value through state, change state using setState();
